# AdaptiveFiltering

Repository containing a Python implemetation of the Matlab [Adaptive Filtering toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/3582-adaptive-filtering)

All classes can be found in the `Sources/adaptive_filtering` folder. 

To run examples translated to Python from the original toolbox, check the `Examples` folder. The scripts do not need any arguments through the command line and the outputs are stored by default in the `Examples/Outputs` folder (such filepath can be changed in each script though).
